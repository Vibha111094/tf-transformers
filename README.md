<p>tf-transformers: faster and easier state-of-the-art NLP in TensorFlow 2.0
</h3>

tf-transformers is designed to harness the full power of Tensorflow 2, to make it much faster and simpler comparing to existing Tensorflow based NLP architectures. On an average, there is ```80 % ``` improvement over current exsting Tensorflow based libraries, on text generation. You can find more details in the Benchmarks section.

All / Most NLP downstream tasks can be integrated into Tranformer based models with much ease. All the models can be trained using ```model.fit```, which supports GPU, multi-GPU, TPU.

## Unique Features
- Faster text generation using Tensorflow2. Faster than PyTorch in most experiments (V100 GPU). ```80%``` faster compared to existing TF based libararies (relative difference) Refer [benchmark code](tests/notebooks/benchmarks/).
- Complete TFlite support for BERT, RoBERTA, T5, Albert, mt5 for all down stream tasks except text-generation
- Faster sentence-piece alignment (no more LCS overhead)
- Variable batch text generation for Encoder only models like GPT2
- No more hassle of writing long codes for TFRecords. minimal and simple.
- Off the shelf support for auto-batching ```tf.data.dataset``` or ```tf.ragged```tensors
- Pass dictionary outputs directly to loss functions inside ```tf.keras.Model.fit``` using ```model.compile2``` . Refer [examples]() or [blog]()
- Multiple mask modes like ```causal```, ```user-defined```, ```prefix``` by changing one argument . Refer [examples]() or [blog]()

## Why should I use tf-transformers?

1. Use state-of-the-art models in Production, with less than 10 lines of code.
    - High performance models, better tha all official Tensorflow based models
    - Very simple classes for all downstream tasks
    - Complete TFlite support for all tasks except text-generation

2. Make industry based experience to avaliable to students and community with clear tutorials

3. Train any model on GPU, multi-GPU, TPU with amazing ```tf.keras.Model.fit```
    - Train state-of-the-art models in few lines of code.
    - All models are completely serializable.


4. Customize any models or pipelines with minimal or no code change.


## Installation

### With pip

This repository is tested on Python 3.7+, and Tensorflow 2.4.0

Recommended to use a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

```bash
pip install tf-transformers
```

## Credits

I want to give credits to [Tensorflow NLP official repository](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/nlp). I used November 2020 version of master branch ( where ```tf.keras.Network```) was used for models. I have modified that by large extend now.

Apart from that, I have used many common scripts from many open repos. I might not be able to recall everything as it is. But still credit goes to them  too.
